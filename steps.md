scp -i sshkey.pem rancher.key ec2-user@3.142.248.170:/home/ec2-user/.ssh


•	Logged into Jenkins Server and created rancher.key key-pair for Rancher Server using AWS CLI:
aws ec2 create-key-pair --region us-east-2 --key-name call-rancher.key --query KeyMaterial --output text > ~/.ssh/rancher.key
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/rancher.key

subnet-dc1688b7 | Default in us-east-2a
vpc-5e80f635 (default)

•	Located the initial administrative password.
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

17df358fe8274c599d77c62bf12a1e2b

•	Entered the temporary password to unlock the Jenkins.
3.142.248.170:8080

•	Installed suggested plugins.
•	Created first admin user.
jenkins-admin
J3nkins
http://3.142.248.170:8080/ -- temporary

•	Open your Jenkins dashboard and navigate to Manage Jenkins >> Manage Plugins >> Available tab
•	Located GitHub Integration, Docker Plugin, Docker Pipeline, and Jacoco plugins, then Installed without restart.
•	Configured Docker as cloud agent by navigating to Manage Jenkins >> Manage Nodes and Clouds >> Configure Clouds and using tcp://localhost:2375 as Docker Host URI. (not really needed this) 

•	Attachd a tag to the nodes (intances), subnets and security group for Rancher with Key = kubernetes.io/cluster/Rancher and Value = owned.

ssh -i "rancher.key" ubuntu@ec2-18-222-20-209.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

•	Log into Rancher-Cluster-Instance from Jenkins Server (Bastion host) and install Docker using the following script.
# Set hostname of instance
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname rancher-instance-1
# Updated OS 
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# Since Rancher is not compatible (yet) with latest version of Docker install version 19.03.15 or earlier version using the version string (exp: 5:19.03.15~3-0~ubuntu-focal) from the second column
sudo apt-get install docker-ce=<VERSION_STRING> docker-ce-cli=<VERSION_STRING> containerd.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker

# Add ubuntu user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
newgrp docker
